# MyLib_p5
#### This repository is intended to be a quick and easy library to store my projects in p5.js as well as a library for useful classes for many different objects. All the classes can be found in the ClassLib folder.

## Instructions to use the code
### Some experience
If you have used p5 before, you can use the empty project folder to get started easily, no need to download anything. Just open the html file on the browser to see the canvas.
In general, make sure you have a copy of p5.js in the same folder. Then just open the html file on your browser and enjoy. To download p5.js with a first example of html file visit https://p5js.org/download/.
### Beginnner (more than me!)
If you have never used p5 before, the easiest way to get started is to use the editor for Processing 4.0 (download from https://processing.org/) together with the p5 extension. The editor automatically creates a folder similar to my empty folder in this repo but it updates the html file on its own when you add more files for the same project. Basically, one less thing to worry about! Processing allows you to work locally and offline, if you want to work online the easiest way is to use the p5.js online editor: https://editor.p5js.org/.
If you don't want to use Processing and still work locally and offline, you can donwload p5.js together with a first example from https://p5js.org/download/. Make sure you update the html file if you add more files for the same project, you may want to do this to keep things organized and add files for classes et cetera.
